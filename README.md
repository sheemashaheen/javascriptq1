# 1. What are the different data types in JavaScript?
In JavaScript, there are several different data types. These include:

(a) Number: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.

(b) String: Represents sequences of characters, such as "Hello, World!".

(c) Boolean: Represents either true or false.

(d) Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs. Objects can be created using curly braces {} or with constructor functions.

(e) Array: Represents an ordered list of values, enclosed in square brackets []. Arrays can contain values of any data type.

(f) Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is a value assignment that indicates no value or no object.

(g) Undefined: Denotes an uninitialized variable or a variable with no assigned value. When a variable is declared but not assigned, its value is undefined.

  # Can you explain the difference between null and undefined? #
The main difference between null and undefined is their meaning and how they are typically used:

Null: It is a valid variable with also a value of valid data type or no data type which means in future you can assign a value to it.
For example:
javascript

let myVariable = null;
Undefined: Undefined means variable is incomplete variable and not assigned anything . It is the default value assigned to a declared variable that has not been assigned a value yet. It can also be the value returned by a function that doesn't have a return statement. For example:
javascript

let myVariable;
console.log(myVariable); // Output: undefined

function myFunction() {
  // No return statement
}

console.log(myFunction()); // Output: undefined
In practice, null is used when you want to explicitly indicate the absence of a value, while undefined is more commonly used when a variable has not been initialized or when a function doesn't explicitly return a value.
